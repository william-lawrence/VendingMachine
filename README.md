# Vending Machine

## Introduction
The vending machine program is mini capstone project that I created a Tech Elevator, the coding bootcamp that I attended. The program 
stocks the vending machine via text file. In this case it is the VendingMachine.csv. 

## Requirements
- The vending machine should stock its inventory from a text file.
- The user should be able to view all items that are in the vending machine. 
- The user should be able "feed" money into the machine in predetermined amounts.
